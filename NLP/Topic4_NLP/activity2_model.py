AIT-204 Deep Learning | Topic 4: Natural Language Processing
ACTIVITY 2: Model Architecture — Embeddings + Sentiment Classifier
============================================================================

PURPOSE:
    Define the neural network architecture for sentiment classification.
    This module is imported by Activity 3 (training) and Activity 4 (app).

DURATION: ~75 minutes in-class

BRIDGING THE GAP (Concept -> Algorithm -> Code -> Deployed App):
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    PROBLEM: After Activity 1, each word is an integer ID.
        "great" = 7,  "wonderful" = 15,  "terrible" = 23

    These IDs have NO meaning. Is word 7 closer to word 8 or word 23?
    The integer ordering is arbitrary.

    SOLUTION — EMBEDDINGS:
        Each word gets a dense vector of real numbers (learned during training):
            "great"     -> [ 0.82, -0.15,  0.43, ...]   (64 dimensions)
            "wonderful" -> [ 0.79, -0.12,  0.47, ...]   (similar to "great"!)
            "terrible"  -> [-0.71,  0.23, -0.38, ...]   (far from "great")

    ANALOGY FROM TOPIC 3:
        CNN filters LEARN to detect visual features from pixel values.
        Embedding layers LEARN to detect semantic features from word IDs.

    YOUR MODEL ARCHITECTURE (compare to Topic 2's neural network):

        Topic 2:  [Numerical Features] -> Linear -> ReLU -> Linear -> Output
        Topic 4:  [Word IDs] -> Embedding -> AvgPool -> Linear -> ReLU -> Linear -> Output
                               ^^^^^^^^    ^^^^^^^
                              NEW for NLP   NEW for NLP (rest is same as Topic 2!)

    HOW nn.Embedding WORKS:
        It's a lookup table. A matrix E of shape (vocab_size, embed_dim).
        Given word ID w, it returns row E[w]. That's it.
        During training, backpropagation updates E so similar words
        get similar rows.

    FOR YOUR APP:
        When Activity 4's web app receives a review from the user,
        this model processes it:
            User types review -> Activity 1 preprocesses it -> THIS model predicts sentiment

WHAT YOU'LL IMPLEMENT:
    - SentimentClassifier.__init__(): Define layers
    - SentimentClassifier.forward(): Wire layers together
    - Understand parameter counts and architecture trade-offs

    # ---- REFLECTION QUESTIONS (answer in your report) ----
    #
    # 1. The embedding layer has vocab_size * embed_dim parameters.
    #    For a vocabulary of 50,000 words and embed_dim=256, how many
    #    parameters is that? Is it more or fewer than the classification
    #    layers? What does this tell you about where the "knowledge" lives?
    #
    # 2. We use Average Pooling to go from per-word embeddings to one
    #    sentence vector. "not great" and "great not" produce the SAME
    #    averaged vector. Why is this a limitation? What architectures
    #    solve this? (Hint: Topic 5 covers RNNs)
    #
    # 3. The sigmoid output gives a probability between 0 and 1. We
    #    treat >= 0.5 as positive, < 0.5 as negative. What might it
    #    mean when the model outputs exactly 0.50? Should you trust
    #    a prediction of 0.51 as much as 0.99?
    #
    # 4. Compare this model's architecture to the CNN from Topic 3.
    #    Both take raw data and classify it. What role does the
    #    Embedding layer play that's analogous to Conv layers in a CNN?
