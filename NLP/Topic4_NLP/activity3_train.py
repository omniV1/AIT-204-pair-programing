AIT-204 Deep Learning | Topic 4: Natural Language Processing
ACTIVITY 3: Training Pipeline — Train, Evaluate, Save
============================================================================

PURPOSE:
    Train the sentiment classifier on movie review data, evaluate it,
    plot training curves, and save the trained model + vocabulary to disk.
    These saved artifacts are loaded by Activity 4's web app.

DURATION: ~90 minutes in-class

BRIDGING THE GAP (Concept -> Algorithm -> Code -> Deployed App):
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    The training loop here is STRUCTURALLY IDENTICAL to Topics 1-3:

        for each epoch:
            for each batch:
                1. Forward pass:    predictions = model(inputs)
                2. Compute loss:    loss = criterion(predictions, targets)
                3. Backward pass:   loss.backward()
                4. Update weights:  optimizer.step()
                5. Zero gradients:  optimizer.zero_grad()

    The ONLY difference from Topics 1-2: the input is text (preprocessed
    by Activity 1) instead of raw numbers, and the model has an embedding
    layer (Activity 2) instead of taking numerical features directly.

    FOR YOUR APP:
        This script produces two files:
            saved_model/model.pt   — trained neural network weights
            saved_model/vocab.json — vocabulary mapping words to IDs
        Activity 4's web app loads these to make predictions in real-time.

WHAT YOU'LL IMPLEMENT:
    - The training step (forward, loss, backward, step)
    - The validation evaluation loop
    - Hyperparameter choices (learning rate, epochs, etc.)

RUN THIS FILE: python activity3_train.py
    Produces: saved_model/model.pt, saved_model/vocab.json, plots/

# ---- REFLECTION QUESTIONS ----
#
# 1. Look at the training curves plot. Does the model overfit?
#    How can you tell? What changes would reduce overfitting?
#    (More data, more dropout, fewer epochs, simpler model)
#
# 2. The training loop is the SAME as Topics 1-3. Which line of code
#    is the "forward pass"? The "backward pass"? The "weight update"?
#    Why do we zero gradients at the start of each batch?
#
# 3. Why do we build the vocabulary ONLY on training data?
#    What would go wrong if we included validation data words?
#
# 4. We saved model.pt, vocab.json, and config.json.
#    Why does the app need ALL THREE to make predictions?
#    What happens if vocab.json doesn't match the model's vocab_size?
